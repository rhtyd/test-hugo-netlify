As more and more companies build **internal private clouds** or enter the **service provider market with public clouds**, the more they will need the right set of tools to successfully **build, manage and scale** their **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS) platform. However – choosing the right technology stack can be a difficult decision. There are several aspects that should be considered, such as planning for future growth and demand, team size, budget, project timeframe, previous experience, available hardware and the underlying infrastructure already in place. In this article, we will focus on the **platforms that enable you to provision IaaS** – the software which turns your infrastructure into a fully-featured cloud environment – and also look at key factors which can affect your decision-making process and ensure your cloud project is a success.

When it comes to **cloud management (or cloud orchestration) platforms**, the first thing we need to clarify is what we mean by this. A typical cloud management platform allows one to take existing datacentre infrastructure and wrap around it a common API, CLI and user interface, which allows an organization to benefit from the basic concepts of cloud computing in terms of elasticity, metered usage, self-service and resource pooling.

For some, the first choice to make is whether to go for an **open-source or a proprietary/vendor solution**. This may not come as a surprise to anyone… but at ShapeBlue, we passionately believe the solution should be 100% open-source, and following years of experience, feedback from users and developers, testing most other solutions and working with the community, we also passionately believe the solution should be Apache CloudStack! As we are regularly asked ‘why?’,  we will try to answer that question here.
